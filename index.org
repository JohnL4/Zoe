* Overview 

  University UMC (Chapel Hill) Zoe Friendship Soup project, in all its disorganized glory.

  Source code: https://github.com/JohnL4/Zoe (=.org= files are the original text files (it's a kind of "markdown", if
  anybody is familiar with that terminology); the =.html= files are generated from them).

  "Rendered" web site: https://uumc-zoe.netlify.com/

  This is basically a pile of index cards, viewed in different ways (the table of contents, the "column view", the items
  themselves in the text below).  I may use the github site to track work items, if I get the energy (which would be a
  fourth view, but spiffier.)

  (See also https://zoeempowers.org if you want to know what the heck is going on here.  It's a church fundraiser.)

  All the glory for the initial email and Word docs goes to First United Methodist Church of Cary, NC.

  The .eml file is an email message which /should/ open in whatever is your favorite email client (Outlook, Thunderbird,
  ...).

** Column view

   Tags (see "#+TAGS" line at the top of the =.org= text file):

   - shop :: Shopping legwork
   - talk :: Talk to somebody, in person or on the phone
   - errand :: Run an errand of some sort (but not shopping)
   - captain :: Captain/lead/manage a team of people in a particular activity (e.g., labelling jars)
   - online :: Something that can be done online (like ordering stuff)

    todo-list -- from Cary FUMC folks or from Zoe website -- This is what's referred to as the "todo list" if it's not
    clear from this document (which is also a todo list, confusingly enough).

    assembly instructions (how to run lines)

    ingredient amts per jar for both beef and veg

** What we don't have
* Considerations

** Youth -- sell Souper-Bowl Sunday (after MLK, Feb. 2)

** Youth lockin Fri. after MLK day

   Can do finish-up after jars packed.  (String/tags.)

* TODO TODO-list -- consult list -- plus everything in this section

  Don't need to do bags.  (This year.)  Or we can make them optional.

   Ingredient list, primarily.

** Shopping legwork                                                    :shop:

   Ppl can shop & get reimbursed from missions funds

   need shoppers (costco or sam's club or weaver street bulk or whatever)

*** Investigate bulk food from weaver street                           :talk:
    
*** Ziplock snack bags for pasta                                       :shop:

*** Order boullion from bulkfoods.com?                               :online:

    Order /everything/ from there???
    
** order bags                                                        :online:

   Little paper bags to put jars in for gifts and carrying and whatnot.  Probably good for little presents or fanciness?
   Since we won't be doing this for Christmas this year, maybe not so important?  Would it make carrying the jars
   easier?
   
** label bags                                                       :captain:

   (if we get them)

   u-crew or children's bible study or sunday school classes

** pre-label jars (sticky labels)                                   :captain:

   u-crew or children's bible study or sunday school classes

   maybe we need someone to shepherd this through?
   
** tag jars (strings & tags)                                        :captain:

   More kids' activities?

** day of assembly: a team of captains on MLK day of service (Jan. 20?) :captain:

   Need more than just us two, preferably.

   Replaces Rise against Hunger effort of prev. years

   Intent is to have filling stations and "walkers" to move jars from one station to the next.  So, we need a
   person/station (ingredient?) and some "walkers" (not "runners" because these are glass jars).

** Need measuring/scooping equipment for assembly day in fellowship hall :shop:

   bins/bowls to hold bulk materials?

   how many?

** IN-PROGRESS Buy jars                                         :talk:online:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :WHO:      Erika
   :END:
** Buy gloves and hairnets (for food handling)                         :shop:
** Find something to keep filled jars in

   The filled jars will be heavier than the empty ones, so if the empty jars come in big boxes, we need to make sure
   they'll hold the weight of the filled jars.

  ...with total quantities required.

* Yet Another Way of Slicing and Dicing Tasks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tasks-in-github
  :END:

  I'm experimenting with using GitHub to manage tasks. Chances are it's too complicated, but I
  thought I'd try it.

  (We'll probably use something like Signup Genius for people to volunteer, in the end.)

  - [[HTTPS://github.com/JohnL4/Zoe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen][BIG TASK LIST]]
  - [[https://github.com/JohnL4/Zoe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AErrand][Tasks labelled "Errand"]]
  - [[https://github.com/JohnL4/Zoe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AManageWorkgroup][Tasks labelled "ManageWorkgroup"]]

  - [[https://github.com/JohnL4/Zoe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3APhoneTalk][Tasks labelled "PhoneTalk"]]
  - [[https://github.com/JohnL4/Zoe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AShopBigBox][Tasks labelled "ShopBigBox"]]

  Basically, the idea is to group similar type tasks together for people who prefer one kind of task
  over another.  It's possible for one task to be in several groups.

  You can filter a lot of ways (as I said: overkill) with the dropdown menus in the big "Issues"
  list:
