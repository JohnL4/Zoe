* Notes
** What we have now
*** Content
    
    Recipes: beef soup (email, Erika's research)

    Labels: text (downloaded from Zoe website)

    Tags:

    todo-list -- from Cary FUMC folks or from Zoe website -- This is what's referred to as the "todo list" if it's not
    clear from this document (which is also a todo list, confusingly enough).

    assembly instructions (how to run lines)

    ingredient amts per jar for both beef and veg

** What we don't have
* Considerations

** Youth -- sell Souper-Bowl Sunday (after MLK, Feb. 2)

** Youth lockin Fri. after MLK day

   Can do finish-up after jars packed.  (String/tags.)

* TODO TODO-list -- consult list -- plus everything in this section

  Don't need to do bags.  (This year.)  Or we can make them optional.

   jar assembly instructions for veg (how to layer)
   
   recipe instructions for veg (attach to jar)

   what size jars did they use?
   
** Investigate having labels printed (discount through church?)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :WHO:      John
   :END:

   Email or call Betty Peterson or Mary Youngberg.

   Call Kinko's or Copytron to see if they do it and how much it costs.

   Dimensions from todo-list?

   (To John.)

   Ingredient list, primarily.

** Shopping legwork

   Ppl can shop & get reimbursed from missions funds

   need shoppers (costco or sam's club or weaver street bulk or whatever)

*** Investigate bulk food from weaver street
    
*** Ziplock snack bags for pasta

*** Order boullion from bulkfoods.com?

    Order /everything/ from there???
    
** order bags

   Little paper bags to put jars in for gifts and carrying and whatnot.  Probably good for little presents or fanciness?
   Since we won't be doing this for Christmas this year, maybe not so important?  Would it make carrying the jars
   easier?
   
** label bags

   (if we get them)

   u-crew or children's bible study or sunday school classes

** pre-label jars (sticky labels)

   u-crew or children's bible study or sunday school classes

   maybe we need someone to shepherd this through?
   
** tag jars (strings & tags)

   More kids' activities?

** day of assembly: a team of captains on MLK day of service (Jan. 20?)

   Need more than just us two, preferably.

   Replaces Rise against Hunger effort of prev. years

   Intent is to have filling stations and "walkers" to move jars from one station to the next.  So, we need a
   person/station (ingredient?) and some "walkers" (not "runners" because these are glass jars).

** Need measuring/scooping equipment for assembly day in fellowship hall

   bins/bowls to hold bulk materials?

   how many?

** Buy jars
